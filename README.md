# mycroft-medical-example
A example skill to show, how easy it is to create dialogue with mycroft in a medical setting.

To use this skill, use the following commands after each other: (on the device that runs mycroft)

```Bash
cd /opt/mycroft/skills
```

and then  

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasvog/mycroft-medical-example mycroft-medical.mycroftai
```

if mycroft runs in the background, it should automatically load the skill.
