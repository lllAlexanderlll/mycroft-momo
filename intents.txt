intents:
	HeyMomoInit
		utterance: "Hey Momo", but nothing more
		so detect that and forward to the IdentificationOfUser
	IdentificationOfUser
		*user identifies himself* --> known user? yes: PersonalWelcomeMessage no: IntroductionofMomo
	IntroductionofMomo
		bla bla bla --> setInterestList
	PersonalWelcomeMessage
		Hi, Hans! --> MeetSomeone
	getInterestList
	setInterestList
		What are you interested in? Here is a list of suggestions: *see display*, name a few (randomly)
	MeetSomeone
		Wanna join Emmas Reading Club? Then go to the reading area at 5pm.
	
	Yes
	No
	Maybe --> Maybe --> Maybe --> Repeat last spoken words (how?)

What is needed?
	* State variables: {user1 => [interests]}
	* The dialog between user and Momo (intents and stuff)
	* A dynamic list of known interests among all users (DB or filebased?)
	* A list (just some exampled) for events regarding specific interests e.g. reading => "name: Emmas Reading Club, time: 5pm, description: "...""
	* (A description of the event, if time)

What Fallback skills are needed? What is already handled by mycroft itself?
	User says nothing
	User says too much
	User says corrects him/herself

Context Functionality --> remeber the user name and his/her interests as a context variable (dictionary)
Why not just use state variables?!

Is SkillsSetting needed? i.e. default values for stuff
